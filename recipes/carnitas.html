  <h3> About The Dish </h3>
    <p>Mexican carnitas made with pork shoulder, braised with lime and spices for a delicious, distinctive flavor, then baked until fall-apart tender with crisp edges. I get requests from friends and family to make this pulled pork recipe repeatedly. Serve with warm, fresh tortillas and salsa.</p>

        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds pork shoulder, cut into several large pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>

  <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>

      <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
   
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>

      <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season pork shoulder pieces with salt, then arrange in the Dutch oven. Cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.</p>
    
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>

      <p>Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until pork is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</p>
   
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>

      <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    
    <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>

      <p>Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid. Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pork pieces and lightly season with salt.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>

      <p>Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork as it browns.</p>
  
    <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>

      <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
